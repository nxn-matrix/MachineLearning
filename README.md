These are some of the projects done as part of MS in Applied Cognition and Neuroscience at UT Dallas (2019-2022)

1) Designed and implemented modified RegnetX networks. Trained and tested the networks on reduced ImageNet dataset (120K images, 100 classes)
This is an individual project based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.13678.pdf
The Python code can be copied and run from google colab

2) Designed and implemented fully connected and convolutional neural networks. Trained and tested the networks on MNIST dataset (60K images, 10 classes)
This is an individual project.
The Python code can be copied and run from google colab

mnist_scratch_nn.py
mnist_scratch_cnn.py
mnist_scratch_extra.py

3) Implemented transfer learning with data augmentation and fine-tuning on 9 state-of-the-art CNN models (VGG19 and Xception code shared here). Trained and tested the models on “Stanford Cars” dataset (16K images,196 classes).
This is group project.
The Jupyter notebooks can be run from google colab
